Description:
Kisan Link is a first-of-its-kind agriculture management system designed by a group of enthusiastic students. The
application aims to help farmers manage various aspects of farming, including weather forecasting, soil analysis,
inventory control, and fertilizer calculation. While still in its infancy, Kisan Link offers an intuitive user
interface with a sidebar menu for easy navigation.

Key Features:
1. Weather Forecasting: Stay updated on daily weather conditions to help you make informed decisions about when to
plant, irrigate, or protect crops from adverse weather events. However, please note that the data provided may not
be as accurate as professional weather forecasts due to our limited expertise.
2. Soil Analysis: Analyze soil health by testing its pH level, moisture content, and nutrient composition. Receive
recommendations for appropriate fertilizers and farming practices to improve soil productivity. Keep in mind that
the advice provided should be verified with a professional soil scientist or agricultural extension agent for
optimal results.
3. Inventory Control: Keep track of your inventory of seeds, tools, and other agricultural supplies. Stay informed
about stock levels and automatically generate purchase orders when necessary. Although we strive to provide
accurate data, there may be discrepancies in the system due to our limited experience.
4. Fertilizer Calculator: Determine the required amount of fertilizer for your crops based on the nutrient rate
application and percentage in the fertilizer. Be aware that the accuracy of the calculator may vary, as it was
created by individuals with limited knowledge in this area.
5. Sidebar Menu: Access all the features easily with a convenient sidebar menu, featuring buttons for Home, Soil,
Fertilizer, and Weather sections. Despite our best efforts to make navigation simple, there may be some areas of
the application that require additional refinement.
6. Intuitive Design: The application is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for farmers of all skill
levels to navigate and utilize its features effectively. Please bear in mind that we are a group of novices, so
there might be room for improvements and optimizations.
7. Greeting Functionality: Kisan Link greets the user based on the current time of day, adding a personal touch to
your experience with the application. While we aimed to create a welcoming atmosphere, there may be occasional
errors or inaccuracies in the greetings.
8. Splash Screen: A visually appealing splash screen greets users upon opening the application, setting the stage
for an enjoyable and efficient farming management experience. Although our design is modest, we are proud of what
we have achieved so far and hope to continue improving Kisan Link in the future.

To get started with Kisan Link, simply run the provided code and follow the on-screen instructions. We invite
farmers and developers alike to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement as we continue to develop this
tool for the farming community. Our ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive agriculture management system that
simplifies farming operations for all, regardless of their level of expertise.
